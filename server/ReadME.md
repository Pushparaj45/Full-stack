# Cloning, Installing Dependencies, and Running a Node.js and MongoDB Project

This documentation will guide you through the process of cloning a Node.js and MongoDB project from GitHub, installing the required Node.js modules using npm (Node Package Manager), and running the project on your local development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- MongoDB (Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your system)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pushparaj45/full-stack.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate into the project directory that was created by the cloning process. Use the `cd` command followed by the directory name:

```bash
cd project_directory
```

Replace `project_directory` with the name of the directory that was created during the cloning process.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once you are inside the project directory, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure MongoDB Connection 

If the project requires a MongoDB connection, make sure to configure the connection settings in the project. This typically involves updating the MongoDB connection URI or configuration file.

### 5. Run the Project

After installing the dependencies and configuring the MongoDB connection (if needed), you can run the Node.js project. Use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

# Installing MongoDB and Connecting it to Node.js with Express

This documentation will guide you through the process of installing MongoDB and setting up a connection to a Node.js application using the Express framework.

### Initialize npm

Initialize npm in your project directory to create a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for your Node.js project:

```bash
npm install express mongoose cors
```

- `express`: A Node.js web application framework for building web servers.
- `mongoose`: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- `cors`:  A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
