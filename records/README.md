# Cloning, Installing Dependencies, and Running a React Project

This documentation will guide you through the process of cloning a React project from GitHub, installing the required Node.js modules using npm (Node Package Manager), and running the project on your local development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pushparaj45/full-stack.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate into the project directory that was created by the cloning process. Use the `cd` command followed by the directory name:

```bash
cd full-stack\records>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once you are inside the project directory, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server to run the React project locally. Use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Additional Notes

- If the development server fails to open the project in your browser automatically, you can manually open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified).
- To stop the development server, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where the server is running.
