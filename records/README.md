# Cloning, Installing Dependencies, and Running a React Project

This documentation will guide you through the process of cloning a React project from GitHub, installing the required Node.js modules using npm (Node Package Manager), and running the project on your local development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate into the project directory that was created by the cloning process. Use the `cd` command followed by the directory name:

```bash
cd full-stack\records>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once you are inside the project directory, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file in the project directory and install all the required Node.js modules.

### 4. Run the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server to run the React project locally. Use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server and automatically open the project in your default web browser. You can now view and interact with the React application.

### Additional Notes

- If the development server fails to open the project in your browser automatically, you can manually open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified).
- To stop the development server, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where the server is running.

## Conclusion

You have successfully cloned a React project from GitHub, installed the required Node.js modules using npm, and run the project on your local development server. You can now start exploring and modifying the project as needed.
